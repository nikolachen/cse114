This is a sample `Markdown` file. *Markdown* is a
simple notation for translating **plaintext** documents
into **HTML**. Instead of using exotic [HTML](http://www.w3.org)
tags like `<code>`, Markdown lets you use simple text symbols to
indicate how to display different kinds of text. For example,

here is some code to display a "smiley-face" image:

![Happy face](/mysite/images/smiley.jpg "My smiley face image")

If you run this text through your *MarkdownTranslator* program,
you should receive a neatly-formatted HTML version of this *file*.

+ This is a simple unordered list
+ It contains a total of three list items
+ and should be surrounded by the correct UL tags in the HTML version

This is the *last* line in the test file.
